Pseudoinverse Computation via Tensorstructure for Cellmatrices in finite Elements

This framework is built on basis of the my bachelorthesis. 
It's goal is to compute the pseudoinverse of the cellmatrix in finite Elements via two different approaches.

One approach is to make use of the tensorstructure and use sum-factorization. 
The second approach is to use HOSVD.
