function SF = sf_generate(pol_deg)    % This script defines a matrix called SF saving in each row a shape function. The shape function is represented as coefficient vector.    % The shape functions are in lexicographical order. More over the shape functions are defined on the unit square.    % We want to use transformations to transform those shape functions to the shape functions of individual cells.        % ------ Mesh and Cell properties -------    dimension_domain = 2;    k = 0;    nodes_counter =  (factorial(dimension_domain)/(factorial(k)*factorial(dimension_domain-k))) * pol_deg^k * (pol_deg+1)^(dimension_domain-k);    row_counter = pol_deg + 1 ;    nodes_per_row = nodes_counter / row_counter;    % Calculate mesh_size so we can generate a mesh. We can use our mesh_generate() function because we want our shape functions on the    % reference Cell, which is a unit square. Our nodes should be equidistant. mesh_generate() perfectley does that.    mesh_size = 1/(nodes_per_row-1);    % Our nodes matrix is equal to the vertex matrix in that case.
